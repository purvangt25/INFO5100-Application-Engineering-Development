Final Project:
RESCUE:Resilience Co ordination under Emergencies

Resilience involves identifying and nurturing the capacity to cope with the myriad stresses that life inevitably brings. It involves identifying and nurturing the capacity for governments, metro-regions, communities, and private-sector entities to understand and better manage increasingly interconnected and interdependent systems that elevate the risk of wide-reaching and cascading failures when placed under stress. 
 
The purpose of this application is to organize and manage resources and responsibilities for dealing with all humanitarian aspects of emergencies, in particular preparedness, response and recovery in order to lessen the impact of disasters. 

The enterprises need to work in unity to ensure the victims are provided with the necessary amenities and bring them to safety. This is achieved by the application that would help prioritize and manage the responsibilities.
